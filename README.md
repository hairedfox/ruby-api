# Notes
- Remember to create the databases first `ruby_api_development`, `ruby_api_test`
- Create `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file and change the information of `DB_URL` and `TEST_DB_URL` to make it work properly.
- Run seed `ruby db/seed.rb`
- Run server: `rackup`

Server will be running in port `1337` by default.
